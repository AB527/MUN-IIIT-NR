With only a month to prepare, our team’s dedication made it possible. We meticulously planned every detail, from securing sponsorships to PR and social media efforts. The result was a standout event that enhanced my leadership skills and left a lasting impression. I’m excited to see the next team continue to elevate our club, which has grown from 66 to over 300 participants. Here’s to sustaining our MUN enthusiasm and making a meaningful impact!"
